# hi this is my github
it has links to all my socials (mostly via strawpage or spacehey)

Our names are Nick / Finn / Cass <- Collective names you can use ^_^  
We are a traumagenic system that struggles hugely with memory

WE LOOOOOVVEEEE a lot of interests,,, so many..   

check out our [toyhouse](https://toyhou.se/alienatiic/characters) it has our art, ocs, and fandesigns on there!!! heheheheh 
  
  
im not one to HAVE a dni neccesarily,, just dont be rude and i wont be rude back?  
idk!! but i do have ONE boundary that i feel is important to discuss:   
  
**AGES.**  
if you are under the age of 15, or older than 25, please do NOT interact with us.  
**ONLY EXCEPTIONS BEING FRIENDS WEVE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME**   
it makes us severely uncomfortable being friends with people of those age ranges  
and overall is really wierd in our personal opinion.  
small conversations are alright, like crowns or simple fandom discussion of course!  
**BUT** being *friends* if you are in that range, is an absolute NO GO!
